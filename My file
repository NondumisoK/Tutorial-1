My name is Nondumiso Khumalo. My email address is ndumidurbs@gmail.com. My honours project will be on the "Cross-correlation between
the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect with the peculiar velocity field". This involves the study of the distortion of the CMB by the high energy
electrons in galaxy clusters. This distortion reveals more about the properties of the galaxy clusters.

I would like to learn programming in this module at a higher level, such that I can apply it to simple daily programming as well as to higher data analysis
programming.
